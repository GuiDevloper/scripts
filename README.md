What if scripts of things could become programming scripts?

Everyday everybody comes across things that looks very alike to an collection of sequential procedures, which could mean everybody already had a contact with programming when using it to program their routine and functioning of things around.

This repository shows examples of those "everyday scripts" written step-by-step on programming languages, helping people to learn code visualizing in it stories and their own diverse experiences.

## Running an example

> Except if shown otherwise, the scripts can run in both browser and terminal.

At terminal, just go to the folder containing the code files and run what you choose:

```sh
cd src/JS
node Cinderela.js
```

And it should give feedback :)
